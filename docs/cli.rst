Usage

you kept the name of the virtualenv as described above, just enter the
directory, and itâ€™ll be automatically activated. Else:

.. code:: bash

    $ source ${PWD##*/}_marina/bin/activate

To leave that environment:

**WARNING: Make sure that you are in a virtual environment. To verify
that, check that your prompt starts with something like
``(xyz_marina)``**
