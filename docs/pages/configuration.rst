Configuration
=============

Copy the file ``conf/compose.ini.tpl`` to ``conf/compose.ini`` and set
the right Configuration parameters. The config validation is defined in configspec.ini

Everything should be defined in the ``[main]`` section.

.. WARNING::
   Don't use double quotes to protect your values.

   Use ``#`` to comment your lines and not ``;``


Network and changes in general
------------------------------------
You can define your own network in compose.ini (``subnet`` and `gateway``).

.. WARNING::
   If you change that, run ``docker-clean`` which
   removes orphans images, stopped container, etc ...

   Also, if you change any parameter such as an environment variable
   run a `marina restart --recreate` to make sure that you start from
   a clean environment.


Services
-----------------
You can define the list of services you want to have. Each service
consists of a yml file in the ``services/`` directory. Each container
("Virtual Machine") will have a hostname composed of the project name
and the service name. To reach, for example, the elasticsearch server
from a web application, and if your ``project_name = marina`` use
``marina_elasticsearch`` or to connect to mysql use ``marina_mysql``.
The service names also works (*elasticsearch* and *mysql*)

.. code:: cfg

    # Comma separated list of services to start
    # Valid values: apache / bonita / elasticsearch / mailcatcher / maildev / mongo /
    # mysql / php / phpmyadmin / python / redis / xhgui
    services=apache,php,mysql

A service can launch a post-start script that has the same name with an
``.sh`` extension (example: ``services/mysql.sh``).


Special case of xhgui service
----------------------------------
To be able to profile your script, add the service xhgui and read the
`documentation`_


Other useful parameters
--------------------------

Project name (will be used as container's prefix). It should be
different for each project.

.. code:: ini

    # Change Machines names only if you need it
    project_name=marina

PHP Version :

.. code:: ini

    # Set your PHP version from 5.3 to 7.0 (5.6 by default)
    php.version=7.0

MySQL Password if mysql is defined in the services list:

.. code:: ini

    # Password set on first start. Once the data exist won't be changed
    mysql.root_password=changeme

Memory assigned to the VMS:

.. code:: ini

    apache.ram=512M
    elasticsearch.ram=512M
    mysql.ram=512M
    php.ram=512M

Files location
------------------

Public Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  All files served by the web server are located into ``www/``


Services Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  MySQL data is into ``data/mysql``
-  Mongo data is into ``data/mongo``
-  ElasticSearch data is into ``data/elasticsearch``
-  Redis data is into ``data/redis``

Logs
~~~~~~
-  Logs for Apache and PHP are located into ``logs/``
-  Logs for MySQL are located into ``data/mysql/`` (slow and error).

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  If you need to override the PHP configuration you can put a file in
   ``conf/php-fpm-override`` with a ``.conf`` extension. The format is
   the fpm configuration files one. Example:
   ``php_value[memory_limit] = 127M``.
-  If you need to override the mysql configuration you can put a file in ``conf/mysql-override``
   with a ``.cnf`` extension.


Add binaries
------------
You can add binaries (such as phpunit) that will automatically be
available from the PATH by putting it to ``home/www-data/bin/``


.. IMPORTANT::
   You can use ``home/www-data`` to put everyhting you need to keep:
   your shell parameters in `.bashrc`, your ssh keys/config into `.ssh`, etc.
